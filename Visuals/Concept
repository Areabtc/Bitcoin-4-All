The visual identity of Bitcoin4All is all about being easygoing, fun, and super accessible to everyone. 
The goal is to make learning about Bitcoin not feel like a chore, but something that anyone can dive into, no matter where they're starting from. 

The main colors, orange and lime green, were picked to give off vibes of energy, optimism, and a fresh take on things. 
Orange is all about Bitcoin (of course) but also creativity and excitement, while lime green symbolizes growth, renewal, looking toward the future and its shift away from the old fiat mindset.

The logo, featuring the silhouette of two hands giving a high-five, is a perfect symbol of collaboration and mutual support among Bitcoiners.
It captures the idea that we’re all in this together (yeah, not a meme) helping each other speed up the mental shift from fiat to Bitcoin. 
The high-five itself is energetic and positive, representing how learning Bitcoin doesn’t have to be hard—it’s actually fun and empowering.

The course is free, open-source, and collaborative, and the logo really speaks to that community-driven spirit. 
It shows how every person involved is helping to spread Bitcoin seeds of knowledge far and wide. 

The whole vibe of the branding is to create a welcoming, exciting space where anyone can get involved and contribute to building a global network of Bitcoin educators.
It’s all about making Bitcoin mindset something anyone can embrace, without it feeling intimidating or boring.
