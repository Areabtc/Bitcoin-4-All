Why is holding Bitcoin so important? If you are just starting out in Bitcoin, this question makes a lot of sense! It's normal to think: "Hey, isn't it just a matter of buying and waiting for the price to go up?" And here comes the surprise: you also have to learn how to save.

But relax, saving Bitcoin is no big deal! But rather a fundamental part of ensuring that, in a few years, all today's effort will be worth it and your Bitcoins will still be with you, safe and untouched.


(slide 253)
Bitcoin works differently from banks and the traditional financial system, as it allows you to truly own your own money, without depending on anyone else, much less banks. This is powerful stuff and is the opposite of how most people keep their own money these days.

In the traditional financial system, the money you have in your bank account is not exactly under your control. In practice, the bank takes care of it, which does so under the promise that YOUR money will be safe with them. 


(slide 254)
But history has proven that the money in the bank is not in the bank, it is not yours and it is not real money. This is because banks don't have their customers' money: if everyone who has a bank account decides to withdraw their own money, the banks will fail. They would not support mass looting movements. 


(slide 255)
This is what happened in the banking crisis in 2023 in the USA, where banks collapsed when customers rushed to withdraw in fear of the bankruptcy of these intermediaries. Even Credit Suisse had to be rescued by UBS, otherwise it would go bankrupt. History is full of evidence of how banks don't have people's money if everyone needs to withdraw their balances at a moment's notice.


(slide 256)
The money in the bank isn't even really yours. When you deposit money in the bank, it stops being yours. That's right! The bank becomes the owner and you become a "creditor". You trust that he will keep it correctly and return it when asked, but this trust has its risks.

Seems safe, right? But it's not quite like that. Banks can fail, as happened in the 2008 crisis with Lehman Brothers. And then, whoever had money there was left in the lurch. Even with insurance and protections, these funds usually only cover a portion of the amount you had saved.

And if that wasn't enough, when you need to withdraw a larger amount, the bank can make your life difficult. Endless questions, blocked transactions, daily limits... All because, while your money is there, the bank uses it to lend and invest as it sees fit.

Now imagine: in a real crisis, when you most need access to your money, the bank may simply not release it. That's why so many people are waking up to the importance of Bitcoin, where you have total control of your money, without depending on anyone.


(slide 257)
But if you think "the bank would never do that to me", it's good to know that it has happened before and can happen again. Want an example? In Lebanon, in 2023, the economic crisis was so great that banks simply they locked the looting. People woke up and discovered they could no longer withdraw their own money.

And it's not just far away that this happened. In Brazil, in 1994, people were hit by the famous confiscation of the Collor Plan. The government froze everyone's savings. Result? Those who had saved up a lifetime of money saw their money confiscated without prior notice and without the chance to withdraw it beforehand.

Another case was the banking crisis in Cyprus in 2013. Banks closed their doors, froze accounts and the government decided to confiscate part of people's money to "save" the financial system. The government imposed a direct seizure of bank accounts as part of the financial rescue organized by the European Union. Accounts with balances above 100,000 euros were the most affected. For those who had more than this amount, the government simply confiscated a significant portion -- in some cases, up to 40% or more of the excess amount.

This means that if you had 200,000 euros in the bank, you could wake up with just 140,000 or even less, with no notice and no chance of getting back what was taken. This measure was called bail-in, where the burden of the crisis fell on the population who had money in banks.

Situations like this make it clear that, in the traditional financial system, the money in the bank is never 100% under your control. With Bitcoin, on the other hand, you don't need to rely on banks or governments to protect your wealth. 

These examples show that when the financial system crashes or collapses, those who end up paying the price are ordinary people, who believed that their money was safe in these companies or institutions.


(slide 258)
And the money you leave in the bank is not real money. AND fiat, is an ice cube without monetary properties that melts in value. Bitcoin is real money, has solid monetary properties and tends to appreciate in value over time. Since you don't need anyone to store it, it gives people back control over their own money. But along with this freedom also comes responsibilities. 

Bitcoin is a bearer asset, which means that only those who have the private keys that give access to the balance can move it. Unlike the traditional system, where banks keep your money (and decide what you can or cannot do with it), in Bitcoin, you are the only one responsible. If you lose your keys, you lose access to your balance forever.

Therefore, protecting your Bitcoin means ensuring that no one, other than you, will have access to your keys and, consequently, your assets. It's a huge power! 


(slide 259)
With Bitcoin, for the first time in history, your money is inaccessible to third parties. Only you can move. This is why self-custody is the best way to store Bitcoin. When you do this, you eliminate the vulnerabilities of trusting third parties that could fail. Either because they didn't take good care of themselves or because they wanted to get their hands on other people's money on purpose.

True financial freedom is back in your hands. So why not use this superpower that bitcoin offers, right?


(slide 260)
Bitcoiners keep repeating the famous phrase: "Not your keys, not your coins", without your keys, without your coins. And you want to know? They are absolutely right.

Exchanges, which were supposed to be just a place to buy Bitcoin, ended up becoming a modern version of banks, only in the Bitcoin universe. And just as banks can fail and take customers' money with them, exchanges can also default and disappear with the Bitcoins that were in their custody.

If you leave your Bitcoins on the exchange, you are taking the same risk that people take when they leave everything in the bank. The difference? With Bitcoin, you have the option of being your own bank.


(slide 261)
This became more than clear when the case of Mt. Gox happened, which was the largest exchange in the world back in 2014. The platform was hacked and puf... 740 thousand customer Bitcoins disappeared. At the time, this was already an absurd amount of money, millions of dollars. Today, it would be worth billions.

And it wasn't just Mt. Gox. More recent cases, such as the collapse of FTX, show that trusting exchanges or banks with your eyes closed is a huge risk. If something goes wrong, whether it's a hack, mismanagement or fraud, you could lose everything you had, and the chance of getting it back is very small.

The lesson is simple: leaving your Bitcoins with a broker is asking to gamble with your luck. The best thing is to take them out and store them yourself, because when you take care of your keys, you take care of your money.


(slide 262)
FTX was one of the biggest examples of why not leave Bitcoin on exchanges. In 2022, from one day to the next, it revealed itself to be a gigantic fraud. Thousands of customers lost what they had and are still fighting in court to try to recover their funds. And you know the worst? These processes can take years, and many people may never see their money back.

And it wasn't just FTX. Other large companies, such as Celsius and BlockFi, also went bankrupt, leaving their customers completely in the lurch. On the other hand, if you do self-custody, that is, you store your Bitcoins yourself, this is no longer a problem. You do not depend on anyone, much less on companies that may be fraudulent or inefficient.

The last point on why self-custody is the best way to store bitcoin is also because it protects you in extreme scenarios. In situations of economic crises, wars or authoritarian regimes, having direct control over your bitcoins can be the difference between being able to escape with your resources or losing everything.

During the war between Ukraine and Russia, many bank accounts were frozen. But those who had bitcoin safely stored were able to cross borders and take their money with them.


(slide 263)
There was even the case of a refugee who managed to travel to Poland with 2 thousand dollars in bitcoin, stored on a simple pendrive. If it weren't for Bitcoin in self-custody, this war refugee would never have been able to take any value, after all, all citizens' accounts were blocked. Bulletproof vests, helmets and supplies were only able to be delivered to protect the population because donations were made in Bitcoin to those on the front line. Meanwhile, money in the banking system was closed and inaccessible to the local population.

Ultimately, self-custody is the only way to ensure your bitcoins are beyond the reach of bankruptcies, hacks, crises or government confiscations. And in such an uncertain world, this is the best way to protect your financial freedom.

Ok, now that you understand that taking Bitcoin from the exchange is important, the question arises: "where exactly do I store my Bitcoin"?


(slide 264)
The safest way to store Bitcoin is in your own wallet.

There are different types of wallets and they all fulfill exactly the same function, which is to store your keys that allow you to move your Bitcoin balance. Dedicated devices are wallets that store keys offline, outside the computer or cell phone, and aim to offer greater security for those who want to store Bitcoin for the long term. 

There are also cell phone, computer or tablet wallets. These are computer programs or cell phone applications that store your keys. As they are always online, they are wallets for everyday use, for smaller transactions that require practicality. As these devices are generally always connected to the internet and interacting with other digital environments, they end up being more susceptible to hacker attacks. Therefore, this type of wallet is not suitable for storing large amounts of Bitcoin or amounts that you want to store for the future with greater security. 

The most incredible thing is that Bitcoin is information and information you can store anywhere. That's why you can have a Bitcoin wallet printed on a sheet of paper (a paper wallet), engraved on a piece of metal or even memorize this information and turn your brain into a Bitcoin wallet. 

Each type of wallet has its own functionality, but not all are suitable for all situations. So it's up to you to choose which type of wallet to use at any given time.

But there is an irony here....


(slide 265)
Bitcoin wallets do not have Bitcoin! It sounds like a joke but it's not! Bitcoin is not stored in wallets, they are always on the blockchain (or timechain) and never leave it. What the wallet does is store and protect the keys that give access to the balance and allow you to move Bitcoin from one address to another. They are always at an address on the network and not within the application or device.


(slide 266)
Wallets are like a digital keychain that stores the codes that authorize transactions with your balance, cryptographically proving that you are the true owner of that balance and can move it. Just like in a keychain you can have different keys that open different doors from different places, in your digital wallet your keys give access to different types of balances and operations. That's why your digital wallet works like a digital keychain.


(slide 267)
When you first set up a wallet, it will generate a string of words for you, like this one on the screen. These words are known as seed phrases. These are words to recover your wallet. With them you can recover your balance on any other device or application, even if your original device breaks, is lost or destroyed by some unexpected misfortune.

This is why you need to be careful with these words, they are what recover your balance and allow you to move your BTC. Therefore, it is important to write them down carefully, legibly, in the exact order in which they appear and store them in a safe place where only you know where they are. If you store your words well, you will always have access to your Bitcoin, but if you don't take good care of it and someone else finds it, they will be able to use your balance and take your Bitcoin for themselves.


(slide 268)
Many people who start accumulating Bitcoin find it a bit archaic to keep words on a piece of paper, but the advantage of keeping your seed words written on paper or a stronger material like metal is that this type of backup drastically reduces the chances of hacks or someone having digital access to your Bitcoin.

Paper or metal are old "technologies" that no one can hack because they are always offline. Additionally, anyone can write a list of words on a piece of paper.

Bitcoin is information, you can even memorize your words and take your Bitcoin wherever you want in your mind. If this information is stored in a computer file, a screenshot from your phone, or a WhatsApp message, it is easier for an attacker to steal your funds. Not because he broke into your wallet, but because you left this information much more exposed than on a piece of paper that only you have access to. It is much more difficult for someone to access it remotely. This is only possible if the person finds out where you left this information, stealing the paper where your seed words are written.


(slide 269)
The expression seed phrase is intentional. It is from there that you can generate thousands of different private keys and bitcoin addresses for different balances. In the same way that from a seed on earth it is possible to grow a tree that branches into thousands of branches with fruit.

Seed words also facilitate storage and avoid errors in self-custody. This is because they represent a large code, with random letters and numbers that are very easy to make mistakes when writing them down. Words are more intuitive, they have meanings, you can even memorize them and they are easier to write and have less chance of error.


(slide 270)
But the question always comes up: "What if someone guesses my words? Could I steal my Bitcoin?" The answer is: no. It's absurdly difficult to simply guess your seed phrase.

The number of all seed combinations that can exist is so large that it is almost incomprehensible. There are more possible combinations of 24-word seed words than there are atoms in the universe! Guessing his words is unlikely, practically impossible.

It is infinitely easier for someone to steal your bitcoins by stealing your seed, if you don't keep it well, than trying to guess by trial and error. This is why most people who lose bitcoin are because they didn't take good care of their own words and not because someone guessed. Bitcoin has no bank account, no manager, no support. Bitcoin is a language, it is a tool. It's up to you to use responsibly and take good care of your keys.


(slide 271)
Ok, now that you understand that wallets give you sovereignty so that you can store, receive and send bitcoin however, whenever and wherever you want, that they generate words that allow you to recover your balance even if the original wallet fails... lastly let's go see what types of wallets are available and in what situation to use each one.

There are two main categories of wallets: cold wallets and hot wallets.

Hot wallets are called that because they are always online and connected to the internet at all times. This type of wallet is very practical to use and move balances, so when you need to make a transaction, just open it and make the payment or transfer. They are generally applications or programs that you install on your computer, generate keys, store and sign transactions. Just open the app and use it. But this practicality brings some risks, this type of wallet is more vulnerable to hacker attacks on the device, that is, it has a larger attack surface. Hot wallets are recommended for storing small amounts of bitcoin, those that you will move on a daily basis.

Cold wallets, on the other hand, are called that because they are offline most of the time, which reduces the attack surface. This type of wallet is more secure and works like a digital safe, which is why it is recommended for storing your bitcoin balance for the future. In this category are hardware devices that are manufactured specifically to generate and store your keys offline. Some models allow you to make air gapped transactions and never connect to the internet, meaning you can sign transactions without plugging the wallet into the internet. Cold wallets include paper wallets, hardware wallets, metal wallets and even brain wallets that are completely analogue, all you need is your brain and a good memory to store the words.

Cold wallets are recommended for storing valuables that you want to protect for the future. Setting up a cold wallet and using it is the first security step, but if you want to advance on this topic, there is, for example, the creation of multisigs, air gapped signatures, pass phrases and other features that you can learn as a continuation of Bitcoin4All.

One last important point when choosing a wallet is to opt for self-custodial wallets, which provide recovery words. So, you can recover your balance in any other wallet using these words. There are also wallets that do not offer the words and keep the keys for you. These wallets are known as custodian wallets. They work almost like exchanges, are responsible for storing your bitcoin and require you to trust them. Therefore, custodian wallets are not recommended for storing your Bitcoin for the long term.

That's why choosing a wallet depends on how you want to use it, what your objective is with the balance you want to store and what your profile is. If you want to use Bitcoin for fast payments, all you need is an app on your phone. If you want to store Bitcoin with maximum security because it has been your hodl for years, then it is better to use a dedicated device. If you are Bitcoin only like me and don't want to know about other shitcoins living in the same wallet as your bitcoin, no problem, there are wallets that are bitcoin only.

So in this class you learned why maintaining your own custody is important, what Bitcoin wallets are and how they work. In the next class we will take the first step towards your sovereignty and show you how to set up a wallet from scratch and withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange. See you next class!
